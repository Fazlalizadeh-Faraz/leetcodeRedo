https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts-v2/functions/ notes from
how many threads of execution -> 1
meaning we can do one thing at a time

everything is on top of the call stack of the global

DRY -> don't repeat your self good principle to follow
you can pass fucntions as arguments to make it more reusable

functions are first class objects
meaning they can be treated exact same as the object
higher order takes the baby function which is the callback function

closure -> return  function from another function
e.preventdefault ignores the html form
 arrow functions dont create new execution
 context
